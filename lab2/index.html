   <Hello World!</h1></Hello>
		<p> We are Caitlin and Pricilla "Percy" and this is our paragraph about ourselves. Percy and Caitlin met in a history class at UCSC. Caitlin is a 4th year history major/theater minor and Percy is a first year History major. Percy is working on a focus on Chicano and Latin American studies and Caitlin is interested in the history of Theater and Performance. When not at school, Percy likes to spend time with her boyfriend and friends and loves to go on new adventures whenever she can. Caitlin is usually at home with her husband, two kids, 2 dogs and four cats. Percy hopes to work in academia or perhaps teach in a high school. Caitlin is hoping to own her own theater company and continue making art. Thank you for checking out our website! </p>
